## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the following are installed and configured:

* Docker Desktop installed on your system
* Kubernetes enabled in Docker Desktop
* `kubectl` command-line tool installed
* Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt


## Step 1: Verify Kubernetes Cluster Status
Run the following command to check whether the local Kubernetes cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Explanation:

* This command lists all Kubernetes nodes.
* If Kubernetes is running correctly, the node status should be `Ready`.

---

## Step 2: Deploy NGINX Using a Deployment YAML File

Apply the deployment configuration using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```
### Explanation:

* This command creates a **Deployment** in Kubernetes.
* The Deployment manages the NGINX container and ensures the required number of Pods are running.
* Kubernetes pulls the official NGINX image and runs it inside a Pod.

---

## Step 3: Check Pod Status

Verify that the Pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Explanation:

* This command shows all Pods created by the Deployment.
* The status should be `Running`, indicating NGINX is running successfully.

---

## Step 4: Expose the Deployment Using a NodePort Service

Expose the application externally using:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello --type=NodePort --port=80
```

### Explanation:

* Pods are internal to Kubernetes and cannot be accessed directly.
* A **Service** of type `NodePort` exposes the application on a port of the local machine.
* Traffic from the browser is forwarded to the NGINX Pod.

---

## Step 5: Get Service Details

Retrieve the service information:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

### Explanation:

* This command displays all Kubernetes services.
* Note the **NodePort** number assigned (for example: `30777`).

---

## Step 6: Access the Application in the Browser

Open a browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<NodePort>
```

### Example:

```
http://localhost:30777
```

### Result:

* The NGINX welcome page should appear, confirming successful deployment.
